# Hybrid Verification
Any system that combines both native blockchain operations and additional external elements for verification and settlement is considered hybrid. These systems utilize internal consensus mechanisms and may also rely on external chains or protocols to enhance interoperability and security.

# Advantages
-Flexibility: Enables interactions across multiple chains while maintaining native functionality.

-Enhanced Security: Leverages both native consensus and external security mechanisms, potentially reducing attack surfaces.

-Interoperability: Facilitates broader asset and data transfers without needing complete reliance on a single blockchain.

# Disadvantages
-Complexity: Dual-layer verification adds to the systemâ€™s complexity, increasing development and maintenance costs.

-Increased Latency: Settlement processes may take longer due to cross-chain verifications.

-Potential Conflicts: Balancing native and external verification methods can lead to coordination issues and dependency risks.
