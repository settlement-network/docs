The primary problem it addresses is the fragmentation of assets and information across multiple blockchains, which limits interoperability and usability. By enabling secure and efficient communication between different blockchains, Entangle aims to create a more interconnected and accessible decentralized ecosystem, allowing users to transfer assets and data without being constrained by the limitations of individual blockchain environments.","sidebar":"architectureSidebar"},"external/index":{"id":"external/index","title":"External Verification","description":"Any system that contains an additional blockchain other than the one that assets are transferred on are considered externally verified.","sidebar":"architectureSidebar"},"external/polygon/index":{"id":"external/polygon/index","title":"Polygon PoS","description":"Polygon PoS is a commit chain built to address Ethereum\'s scalability and high transaction costs. It operates as a multi-chain system, often referred to as \\"Ethereum\'s Internet of Blockchains,\\" aiming to provide a framework for building interconnected blockchain networks. By offering faster transactions and reduced fees, Polygon allows developers to create scalable decentralized applications (dApps) that maintain security and interoperability with Ethereum.","sidebar":"architectureSidebar"},"external/union/index":{"id":"external/union/index","title":"Union","description":"Union is a blockchain platform designed to facilitate secure and efficient cross-chain communication and bridging.
